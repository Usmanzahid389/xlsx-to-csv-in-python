# xlsx-to-csv-in-python


This script will convert all folder of xlsx to csv with multiple sub sheets

Lets say you a have a folder full of xlsx files with multiple sheets and who want to convert them into csv files.
just create two folder one in which all old files are placed and the second where new files will be saved.

run this script by convert.py it will ask you source path. copy and past the source folder path.. it will create csv and stored them into new folder.

Thanks
